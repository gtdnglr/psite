# My Resume Site
The ultimate goal in creating this website is to not only showcase my skills but also advertise myself and my quest to find a software developer postion. The website uses Django for the back-end and Bootstrap for the front-end with some custom CSS here and there.

## Back-end
The back-end side of the website uses Django and SQL to power it. From the Django admin back-end I have added all the necassary admin pages to be able to dynamically update the information on the website making it extremely quick and easy to keep current.

## Front-end
The front-end of the website uses Boostrap as well as a few custom CSS files to give it the appearence that I am going for. While it may seem like a simple Bootstrap site with static HTML for the display of my resume it is actually a lot more complex than that. Every single item on my resume page is pulled directly from a database and rendered out in a pleasing fashion for people to view it. The custom CSS allows me to have total control over exactly how the website is viewed by the end user.

## Hosting
The website is hosted on a Heroku Dyno that automatically redploys it every time a change is uploaded to this Github Repository which makes it extremely streamlined and automated as far as keeping it up to speed.
